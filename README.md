# Viral-Pneumonia-Detection-Using-3D-Image-Classification

Aim: To classify CT-Scans as normal or abnormal based on the presence of viral pneumonia

Libraries Used: Tensorflow and Keras

Dataset Details: A subset of the dataset by [MosMedData: Chest CT Scans with COVID-19 Related Findings](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.20.20100362v1) which consists about 200 3D CT scans in total comprising the 2 classes. Note that each sample is of shape 128,128,64.
